## Hey, I'm Himel ðŸ‘‹

A 16-year-old astronerd from Bangladesh exploring the cosmos through astrophysics, computational science, and open-source technology. Here I write about space, FOSS, scientific research, and the tech that powers discovery.

When I'm not observing the night sky or building tools, you'll find me leading science outreach with [Stargzr](https://github.com/hello2himel) or tinkering with Linux systems.

**Topics you'll find here:** Astrophysics â€¢ Python â€¢ Linux & FOSS â€¢ Scientific Computing â€¢ Space Exploration
